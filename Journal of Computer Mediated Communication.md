### Digital Communication Media Use and Psychological Well-Being：A Meta-Analysis

The puzzle of whether digital media are improving or harming psychological well-being has been
plaguing researchers and the public for decades. Derived from media richness theory, this study
proposed that phone calls and texting improve well-being, while use of social network sites (SNSs),
instant messaging (IM), and online gaming may displace other social contacts and, thereby, impair
well-being. To test this hypothesis, a meta-analysis of 124 studies was conducted. The results showed
that phone calls and texting were positively correlated with well-being, whereas online gaming was
negatively associated with well-being. Furthermore, the relationship between digital media use and
well-being was also contingent upon the way the technology was used. A series of meta-analyses
of different types of SNS use and well-being was used to elucidate this point: interaction, selfpresentation,
and entertainment on SNSs were associated with better well-being, whereas consuming
SNSs’ content was associated with poorer well-being.

### Flagging Facebook Falsehoods：Self-Identified Humor Warnings Outperform Fact Checker and Peer Warnings

We present two studies evaluating the effectiveness of flagging inaccurate political posts on social
media. In Study 1, we tested fact-checker flags, peer-generated flags, and a flag indicating that the
publisher self-identified as a source of humor. We predicted that all would be effective, that their
effectiveness would depend on prior beliefs, and that the self-identified humor flag would work best.
Conducting a 2-wave online experiment (N=218), we found that self-identified humor flags were
most effective, reducing beliefs and sharing intentions, especially among those predisposed to believe
the post.We found no evidence that warnings from fact checkers or peers were beneficial. Compared
to the alternatives, participants exposed to self-identified humor flags exhibited less reactance to
and had more positive appraisals of the flagging system. The second study (N=610) replicated the
findings of the first and provides a preliminary test of what makes this flag work.

### Social Media and Change in Psychological Distress Over Time：The Role of Social Causation

This article tests the relationship between information and communication technologies (ICT), such
as the Internet, cell phones, and socialmedia, and change over time in psychological distress (PD) and
risk of serious psychological distress (SPD) associated with depression and anxiety disorders. Using
a longitudinal panel design, survey data from a representative sample of American adults, findings
revealed that home Internet and social network site (SNS) use are associated with decreased PD over
time. Having extended family who are also Internet users further decreases PD. PD increased or
decreased in relation to change in the PD of extended family who also use SNSs. For most people,
ICT substantively reduce PD; in rare cases, an extreme spike in PD of extended family also on SNSs,
there was a trivial increase to the risk of SPD. PD did not change when extended family not on social
media experienced a change in their PD.

### The Influence of Self-Generated and Third-Party Claims Online：Perceived Self-Interest as an Explanatory Mechanism

Over the past two decades, communication technology scholars have examined how viewers evaluate
the authenticity of information online, with particular attention given to how self versus thirdparty
claims differ in their degree of influence. We examine how self-interest perceptions serve an
important explanatory function in the logic of warranting theory and help account for how people
evaluate content online. Our results document how the source and valence of a message can interact
toaffect perceptions of source self-interest,which, inturn, affectperceptions of source trustworthiness,
message accuracy, and, ultimately, evaluations of an online target. The findings establish boundary
conditions for the warranting principle and our discussion offers insight into the production and
evaluation of online claims.
