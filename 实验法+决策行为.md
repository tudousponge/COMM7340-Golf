### Exemplar Effects on Public Opinion Perception and Attitudes: The Moderating Role of Exemplar Involvement (Human CommunicationResearch Volume 1804)  

Abstract:  
The depiction of citizens expressing their opinions in the news is an increasingly popular feature of modern journalism, because they can serve as exemplars that illustrate abstract or complex issues. However, citizen exemplars differ regarding their level of personal involvement in the issue they talk about. Affected exemplars have some kind of personal experience with an issue (e.g. ill people) whereas unaffected citizens, as ordinary “people from the street,” do not. We examine for the first time how exemplars’ personal involvement moderates their effects on recipients’ perceptions of public opinion and personal attitudes. The results show that compared to unaffected exemplars, affected exemplars weaken effects on public opinion perceptions.
In contrast, the moderating role of exemplar involvement for attitudinal effects was limited.

### Flagging Facebook Falsehoods：Self-Identified Humor Warnings Outperform Fact Checker and Peer Warnings(Journal of Computer Mediated Communication 1909)

Abstract:  
We present two studies evaluating the effectiveness of flagging inaccurate political posts on social media. In Study 1, we tested fact-checker flags, peer-generated flags, and a flag indicating that the publisher self-identified as a source of humor. We predicted that all would be effective, that their effectiveness would depend on prior beliefs, and that the self-identified humor flag would work best. Conducting a 2-wave online experiment (N=218), we found that self-identified humor flags were most effective, reducing beliefs and sharing intentions, especially among those predisposed to believe the post.We found no evidence that warnings from fact checkers or peers were beneficial. Compared to the alternatives, participants exposed to self-identified humor flags exhibited less reactance to and had more positive appraisals of the flagging system. The second study (N=610) replicated the findings of the first and provides a preliminary test of what makes this flag work.我们提出了两项研究，以评估在社会上标记不准确的政治帖子的有效性媒体。在研究1中，我们测试了事实检查器标志、同行生成标志和指示出版商自认为是幽默的源泉。我们预测，所有这些都将是有效的，他们的有效性取决于先前的信念，而自我认同的幽默标志效果最好。我们进行了一个两波在线实验(N=218)，发现自我识别的幽默标志是最有效的，减少信念和分享意图，特别是在那些倾向于相信的人之间这个职位。我们没有发现任何证据表明来自事实核查人员或同行的警告是有益的。相比在另一种情况下，暴露在自我认同幽默标志下的参与者对幽默表现出较少的抗拒对标记系统的评价更加积极。第二项研究(N=610)证实了这一结论第一个发现，并提供了一个初步的测试，什么使这面旗帜工作。

### Permanently on Call：The Effects of Social Pressure on Smartphone Users’ Self-Control, Need Satisfaction, and Well-Being (Journal of Computer Mediated Communication 1907)

Abstract:  
While many smartphone users experience social pressure to be available, only some perceive this as a burden. It was hypothesized that this form of social pressure is especially detrimental when it reduces self-control and hinders need satisfaction. Study 1 experimentally tested whether the fulfillment of intrinsic needs (i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness) in mobile communication mediates these associations. Results show that social pressure negatively affected autonomy and competence, but did not influence relatedness. Repeated-measures data from Study 2 suggest that social pressure leads to self-control failure, which is associated with reduced competence. This research is the first to develop and test a theoretical model of the effects of social pressure to be available on self-control, need satisfaction, and individuals’ well-being.尽管许多智能手机用户面临着社交压力，但只有一部分人意识到了这一点作为一个负担。据推测，这种形式的社会压力尤其有害降低自我控制和阻碍需求满足。研究1实验验证了是否满足内在需要(即在移动通信中的自主性、能力和关联性)调和这些关联。结果表明，社会压力对学生的自主能力和学习能力有负向影响能力，但不影响亲缘关系。研究2的重复测量数据表明社会压力导致自我控制失败，这与能力下降有关。这研究是第一个发展和测试社会压力影响的理论模型可用于自我控制、需求满足和个人幸福。

### Is That My Friend or an Advert？The Effectiveness of Instagram Native Advertisements Posing as Social Posts (Journal of Computer Mediated Communication 1905)

Abstract:  
Advertisers have turned attention to the popular photograph-based social network Instagram. One technique for reaching consumers has been advertisements resembling posts one’s friends might make. These native advertisements use Instagram’s conventions and may be unrecognized as sponsored messages at first glance, when browsing one’s Instagram. A within-subjects experiment (N = 482) tested these native ads against both user-generated posts and traditional advertisements. These message types were presented in a repeated-measures design, rotated across three well-known brands, and interspersed with distractor posts. Results indicated that the three message types produced similar effects on ad attitude, brand attitude, and behavioral intention. However, user-generated social posts produced more credibility and social comparison than native ads, and native ads produced more credibility and social comparison than advertisements. This yielded indirect effects on dependent variables of interest, despite the lack of total effects. Sponsorship recognition was relatively high for native ads but did not mediate effects. 广告商已经将注意力转向了基于图片的社交网络Instagram。一种接触消费者的方法是发布类似朋友的广告可能会使。这些原生广告使用了Instagram的惯例，可能不会被认出来浏览Instagram时第一眼看到的赞助信息。一个受试实验(N = 482)将这些原生广告与用户生成的帖子和传统广告进行对比。这些消息类型以一种重复度量设计的形式呈现，并在三种设计中轮换使用知名品牌，并散布着分散注意力的帖子。结果表明，这三个消息类型对广告态度、品牌态度和行为意向的影响相似。然而，用户生成的社交帖子比原生的更能产生可信度和社会比较与广告相比，本土广告产生了更多的可信度和社会比较。这产生了对相关因变量的间接影响，尽管缺乏总体影响。赞助认可度相对较高的原生广告，但没有间接影响。

### Fake images: The effects of source, intermediary, and digital media literacy on contextual assessment of image credibility online(昕之推荐)

Abstract:  
Fake or manipulated images propagated through the Web and social media have the capacity to deceive, emotionally distress, and influence public opinions and actions. Yet few studies have examined how individuals evaluate the authenticity of images that accompany online stories. This article details a 6-batch large-scale online experiment using Amazon Mechanical Turk that probes how people evaluate image credibility across online platforms. In each batch, participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 28 news-source mockups featuring a forged image, and they evaluated the credibility of the images based on several features. We found that participants’ Internet skills,
photo-editing experience, and social media use were significant predictors of imagecredibility evaluation, while most social and heuristic cues of online credibility (e.g. source trustworthiness, bandwagon, intermediary trustworthiness) had no significant
impact. Viewers’ attitude toward a depicted issue also positively influenced their credibility evaluation.通过网络和社交媒体传播的虚假或篡改的图片具有欺骗、情感压抑和影响公众意见和行为的能力。然而，很少有研究调查了人们如何评价网络故事中图片的真实性。本文详细介绍了一个使用Amazon Mechanical Turk的6批大型在线实验，该实验探究了人们如何评估在线平台上的图像可信度。在每一批实验中，参与者被随机分配到28个以伪造图像为特征的新闻源模型中的1个，并根据几个特征来评估图像的可信度。我们发现参与者的网络技能，照片编辑经验和社交媒体使用是图像重可度评价的显著预测因子，而大多数网络可信度的社会和启发式线索(如来源可信度、从众性、中介可信度)没有显著的影响。观看者对所描述问题的态度也对其可信度评价产生了积极的影响。

### Tone Matters: Effects of Exposure to Positive and Negative Tone of Television News Stories on Anti-Immigrant Attitudes and Carry-Over Effects to Uninvolved Immigrant Groupsexp_framing_edw036 [page 218] (昕之推荐)

Abstract:  
The current experimental study (N ¼ 546) compares the effect of exposure to a television news story with a positive and negative tone on anti-immigrant attitudes and carry-over effects to uninvolved immigrant groups. Results reveal that exposure to a ‘‘negatively’’ valenced news story about North African immigrants increased negative attitudes toward that same group. Importantly, however, we find carryover effects of exposure to a ‘‘positively’’ valenced news story about North African immigrants to attitudes toward uninvolved immigrant groups. Together, these findings show that the effect of exposure to television news tone has more ramifications than previously thought, and that the impact of exposure to a positive or negative news story differs for direct effects vis-a-vis carry-over effects.当前实验研究(N¼546)比较暴露在一个电视新闻故事的影响有积极和消极的语气反移民态度冷漠移民团体和遗留的影响。结果显示，接触有关北非移民的“负面”新闻报道，会增加人们对这一群体的负面态度。然而，重要的是，我们发现，接触有关北非移民的“积极”有价新闻报道，会对人们对待不参与其中的移民群体的态度产生持续影响。总的来说，这些发现表明，接触电视新闻基调的影响比之前认为的有更多的分支，而接触正面或负面新闻故事的影响对直接影响和遗留影响是不同的。

### Strategic Media, Cynical Public? Examining the Contingent Effects of Strategic News Frames on Political Cynicism in the United Kingdomexp_framing_01IJPP11_075-101 [page 81] (昕之推荐)

Abstract:  
Through the use of experimental methods, this study examines the claim that strategic news engenders political cynicism. First, it builds upon previous theory by conceptualizing and measuring political cynicism at both issue-specific and global levels. Second, the contingency of framing effects is a contested but crucial area of the framing paradigm and deserves greater attention in strategic framing studies. The study therefore examines this in detail by testing a number of individual characteristics for their moderating effects. The author found that relative to issue-based coverage, strategic news frames increased issue-specific political cynicism, but this effect was only evident for those who were less politically engaged and knowledgeable. The effects of the strategy frame on more global measures of political cynicism were minimal. The findings are discussed in the light of ongoing debates about framing effects and the media’s role in democratic engagement.通过实验方法，本研究检验了战略新闻引起政治犬儒主义的说法。首先，它以先前的理论为基础，在具体问题和全球层面上概念化和衡量政治犬儒主义。第二，框架效应的偶然性是框架范式中一个有争议但又至关重要的领域，值得在战略框架研究中给予更多的关注。因此，这项研究通过测试一些个体特征的调节作用来详细检验这一点。作者发现，相对于基于议题的报道，战略新闻框架增加了特定议题的政治犬儒主义，但这种效果只对那些较少参与政治和知识渊博的人明显。战略框架对更多全球性政治犬儒主义措施的影响微乎其微。这些发现是根据正在进行的关于框架效应和媒体在民主参与中的作用的辩论进行讨论的。

### Bode and Vraga - 2018 - See Something, Say Something Correction of Global (昕之推荐)
Abstract:  
Social media are often criticized for being a conduit for misinformation on global health issues, but may also serve as a corrective to false information. To investigate this possibility, an experiment was conducted exposing users to a simulated Facebook News Feed featuring misinformation and different correction mechanisms (one in which news stories featuring correct information were produced by an algorithm and another where the corrective news stories were posted by other Facebook users) about the Zika virus, a current global health threat. Results show that algorithmic and social corrections are equally effective in limiting misperceptions, and correction occurs for both high and low conspiracy belief individuals. Recommendations for social media campaigns to correct global health misinformation, including社交媒体经常被批评为在全球健康问题上传播错误信息的渠道，但也可能被用来纠正错误信息。调查这种可能性,一个实验进行了暴露用户模拟Facebook新闻Feed错误信息和不同的校正机制(一个新闻故事以正确的信息是由一个算法,另一个在纠正新闻发布了其他Facebook用户)Zika病毒,目前全球卫生威胁。结果表明，算法修正和社会修正在限制误解方面同样有效，高阴谋信念个体和低阴谋信念个体都存在修正。社会媒体运动的建议，以纠正全球卫生错误信息，包括

### How Do New Media Influence Youths’ Health Literacy? Exploring the Effects of Media Channel and Content on Safer Sex Literacy encouraging users to refute false or misleading health information, and providing them appropriate sources to accompany their refutation, are discussed. (昕之推荐)

Abstract:  
This study examines whether youths’ safer sex literacy and their intentions to share healthrelated information are affected by channel (websites vs. social networking sites) and content (fact-based vs. feeling-based content). A 22 factorial experiment with repeated measures was implemented in a large public university in Hong Kong. The results showed that website-based content facilitated respondents’ safer sex literacy and information sharing intentions more effectively than content based on social networking sites. The interaction effect suggests that feeling-based content yielded a stronger effect on information sharing intentions on the website than on the social networking site.本研究探讨青少年的安全性行为素养及分享健康相关资讯的意愿是否受频道(网站与社交网站)及内容(基于事实与基于感觉的内容)的影响。A 2 2 析 因 实验 重复 措施 实施 在 一 个 大型 公立 大学 在 Hong Kong.结果显示，与基于社交网站的内容相比，基于网站的内容更能促进受访者的安全性知识和信息共享意愿。交互效应表明基于情感的内容对网站信息共享意愿的影响比社交网站更大。
