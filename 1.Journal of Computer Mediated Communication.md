### Digital Communication Media Use and Psychological Well-Being：A Meta-Analysis

The puzzle of whether digital media are improving or harming psychological well-being has been
plaguing researchers and the public for decades. Derived from media richness theory, this study
proposed that phone calls and texting improve well-being, while use of social network sites (SNSs),
instant messaging (IM), and online gaming may displace other social contacts and, thereby, impair
well-being. To test this hypothesis, a meta-analysis of 124 studies was conducted. The results showed
that phone calls and texting were positively correlated with well-being, whereas online gaming was
negatively associated with well-being. Furthermore, the relationship between digital media use and
well-being was also contingent upon the way the technology was used. A series of meta-analyses
of different types of SNS use and well-being was used to elucidate this point: interaction, selfpresentation,
and entertainment on SNSs were associated with better well-being, whereas consuming
SNSs’ content was associated with poorer well-being.

### Flagging Facebook Falsehoods：Self-Identified Humor Warnings Outperform Fact Checker and Peer Warnings

We present two studies evaluating the effectiveness of flagging inaccurate political posts on social
media. In Study 1, we tested fact-checker flags, peer-generated flags, and a flag indicating that the
publisher self-identified as a source of humor. We predicted that all would be effective, that their
effectiveness would depend on prior beliefs, and that the self-identified humor flag would work best.
Conducting a 2-wave online experiment (N=218), we found that self-identified humor flags were
most effective, reducing beliefs and sharing intentions, especially among those predisposed to believe
the post.We found no evidence that warnings from fact checkers or peers were beneficial. Compared
to the alternatives, participants exposed to self-identified humor flags exhibited less reactance to
and had more positive appraisals of the flagging system. The second study (N=610) replicated the
findings of the first and provides a preliminary test of what makes this flag work.

### Social Media and Change in Psychological Distress Over Time：The Role of Social Causation

This article tests the relationship between information and communication technologies (ICT), such
as the Internet, cell phones, and socialmedia, and change over time in psychological distress (PD) and
risk of serious psychological distress (SPD) associated with depression and anxiety disorders. Using
a longitudinal panel design, survey data from a representative sample of American adults, findings
revealed that home Internet and social network site (SNS) use are associated with decreased PD over
time. Having extended family who are also Internet users further decreases PD. PD increased or
decreased in relation to change in the PD of extended family who also use SNSs. For most people,
ICT substantively reduce PD; in rare cases, an extreme spike in PD of extended family also on SNSs,
there was a trivial increase to the risk of SPD. PD did not change when extended family not on social
media experienced a change in their PD.

### The Influence of Self-Generated and Third-Party Claims Online：Perceived Self-Interest as an Explanatory Mechanism

Over the past two decades, communication technology scholars have examined how viewers evaluate
the authenticity of information online, with particular attention given to how self versus thirdparty
claims differ in their degree of influence. We examine how self-interest perceptions serve an
important explanatory function in the logic of warranting theory and help account for how people
evaluate content online. Our results document how the source and valence of a message can interact
toaffect perceptions of source self-interest,which, inturn, affectperceptions of source trustworthiness,
message accuracy, and, ultimately, evaluations of an online target. The findings establish boundary
conditions for the warranting principle and our discussion offers insight into the production and
evaluation of online claims.

### Permanently on Call：The Effects of Social Pressure on Smartphone Users’ Self-Control, Need Satisfaction, and Well-Being

While many smartphone users experience social pressure to be available, only some perceive this
as a burden. It was hypothesized that this form of social pressure is especially detrimental when it
reduces self-control and hinders need satisfaction. Study 1 experimentally tested whether the fulfillment
of intrinsic needs (i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness) in mobile communication
mediates these associations. Results show that social pressure negatively affected autonomy and
competence, but did not influence relatedness. Repeated-measures data from Study 2 suggest that
social pressure leads to self-control failure, which is associated with reduced competence. This
research is the first to develop and test a theoretical model of the effects of social pressure to be
available on self-control, need satisfaction, and individuals’ well-being.

### Whose Lives Matter？ Mass Shootings and Social Media Discourses of Sympathy and Policy, 2012–2014

This study focuses on the outpouring of sympathy in response to mass shootings and the contestation
over gun policy on Twitter from 2012 to 2014 and relates these discourses to features of mass
shooting events. We use two approaches to Twitter text analysis—hashtag grouping and supervised
machine learning (ML)—to triangulate an understanding of intensity and duration of
“thoughts and prayers,” gun control, and gun rights discourses. We conduct parallel time series
analyses to predict their temporal patterns in response to features of mass shootings. Our analyses
reveal that while the total number of victims and child deaths consistently predicted public grieving
and calls for gun control, public shootings consistently predicted the defense of gun rights.
Further, the race of victims and perpetrators affected the levels of public mourning and policy
debates, with the loss of black lives and the violence inflicted by white shooters generating less
sympathy and policy discourses.

### Is That My Friend or an Advert？The Effectiveness of Instagram Native Advertisements Posing as Social Posts
Advertisers have turned attention to the popular photograph-based social network Instagram.
One technique for reaching consumers has been advertisements resembling posts one’s friends
might make. These native advertisements use Instagram’s conventions and may be unrecognized
as sponsored messages at first glance, when browsing one’s Instagram. A within-subjects experiment
(N = 482) tested these native ads against both user-generated posts and traditional advertisements.
These message types were presented in a repeated-measures design, rotated across three
well-known brands, and interspersed with distractor posts. Results indicated that the three message
types produced similar effects on ad attitude, brand attitude, and behavioral intention.
However, user-generated social posts produced more credibility and social comparison than native
ads, and native ads produced more credibility and social comparison than advertisements. This
yielded indirect effects on dependent variables of interest, despite the lack of total effects.
Sponsorship recognition was relatively high for native ads but did not mediate effects.

### Motivations, Usage, and Perceived Social Networks Within and Beyond Social Media

This study addresses the questions of how individuals use social media (SM) to build awareness of
social networks (network perceptions) within and beyond SM, and how motivations and SM
behaviors differentiate individuals’ ability to build such awareness. The analysis of the 2017
Taiwan Communication Survey (TCS) identifies three types of users based on their motivations
for SM use: omnivores, time-killers, and social-groomers, who are differentiated from one another
in terms of different types of SM behaviors as well as perceived network structures on SM and
beyond. For example, omnivores, who use SM for diverse purposes, tend to engage in SM browsing
and reacting more than time-killers, who use SM to pass time. Compared to time-killers, socialgroomers,
those who use SM for social purposes, are more likely to perceive that they have a larger
SM response network, a response network containing close ties, and that they have maintained
diverse social relationships in the form of mixed-media relationships (MMRs). Moreover, SM
posting is associated with the size and the diverse composition of the perceived response network
on SM. More frequent SM posting is also associated with perceptions of having diverse social contacts
maintained through MMRs, but such association depends on the size and composition of the
perceived SM response network.

### Strategic Social Grooming：Emergent Social Grooming Styles on Facebook, Social Capital and Well-Being

Social grooming behaviors on social media contribute to one’s social capital and well-being. This
study considered common types of social interactions on social media and proposes a social
grooming style framework developed through signaling theory. Unlike the previous research,
which has examined a single type of social grooming behavior, this study examined many behaviors
simultaneously to identify a social grooming style. With a nationally representative sample
from Taiwan (N = 1,350), a latent class analysis (LCA) revealed five social grooming styles: image
managers, social butterflies, trend followers, maintainers, and lurkers. Social grooming style is significantly
associated with social capital and well-being. Image managers receive the most social
benefits, whereas lurkers receive the fewest. Social butterflies have considerable bridging social
capital and well-being but the least bonding social capital. The results suggest that the rich may
get richer, but only if the engaged social grooming style is strategic.
