### Digital Communication Media Use and Psychological Well-Being：A Meta-Analysis

The puzzle of whether digital media are improving or harming psychological well-being has been
plaguing researchers and the public for decades. Derived from media richness theory, this study
proposed that phone calls and texting improve well-being, while use of social network sites (SNSs),
instant messaging (IM), and online gaming may displace other social contacts and, thereby, impair
well-being. To test this hypothesis, a meta-analysis of 124 studies was conducted. The results showed
that phone calls and texting were positively correlated with well-being, whereas online gaming was
negatively associated with well-being. Furthermore, the relationship between digital media use and
well-being was also contingent upon the way the technology was used. A series of meta-analyses
of different types of SNS use and well-being was used to elucidate this point: interaction, selfpresentation,
and entertainment on SNSs were associated with better well-being, whereas consuming
SNSs’ content was associated with poorer well-being.  
数字媒体究竟是在改善人们的心理健康，还是在损害人们的心理健康困扰了研究人员和公众几十年。本研究源于媒介丰富度理论提出打电话和发短信可以提高幸福感，而使用社交网站(SNSs)，即时通讯(IM)和在线游戏可能会取代其他的社会联系，从而损害幸福。为了验证这一假设，对124项研究进行了荟萃分析。结果显示打电话和发短信与幸福感呈正相关，而网络游戏与幸福感呈正相关与幸福感负相关。此外，数字媒体使用与幸福也取决于技术的使用方式。一系列的元分析不同类型的SNS使用和幸福感被用来说明这一点:互动，自我表现，SNSs上的娱乐与更好的幸福感相关，而消费则与之相反SNSs的内容与较差的幸福感相关。

### Flagging Facebook Falsehoods：Self-Identified Humor Warnings Outperform Fact Checker and Peer Warnings

We present two studies evaluating the effectiveness of flagging inaccurate political posts on social
media. In Study 1, we tested fact-checker flags, peer-generated flags, and a flag indicating that the
publisher self-identified as a source of humor. We predicted that all would be effective, that their
effectiveness would depend on prior beliefs, and that the self-identified humor flag would work best.
Conducting a 2-wave online experiment (N=218), we found that self-identified humor flags were
most effective, reducing beliefs and sharing intentions, especially among those predisposed to believe
the post.We found no evidence that warnings from fact checkers or peers were beneficial. Compared
to the alternatives, participants exposed to self-identified humor flags exhibited less reactance to
and had more positive appraisals of the flagging system. The second study (N=610) replicated the
findings of the first and provides a preliminary test of what makes this flag work.  
我们提出了两项研究，以评估在社会上标记不准确的政治帖子的有效性媒体。在研究1中，我们测试了事实检查器标志、同行生成标志和指示出版商自认为是幽默的源泉。我们预测，所有这些都将是有效的，他们的有效性取决于先前的信念，而自我认同的幽默标志效果最好。我们进行了一个两波在线实验(N=218)，发现自我识别的幽默标志是最有效的，减少信念和分享意图，特别是在那些倾向于相信的人之间这个职位。我们没有发现任何证据表明来自事实核查人员或同行的警告是有益的。相比在另一种情况下，暴露在自我认同幽默标志下的参与者对幽默表现出较少的抗拒对标记系统的评价更加积极。第二项研究(N=610)证实了这一结论第一个发现，并提供了一个初步的测试，什么使这面旗帜工作。

### Social Media and Change in Psychological Distress Over Time：The Role of Social Causation

This article tests the relationship between information and communication technologies (ICT), such
as the Internet, cell phones, and socialmedia, and change over time in psychological distress (PD) and
risk of serious psychological distress (SPD) associated with depression and anxiety disorders. Using
a longitudinal panel design, survey data from a representative sample of American adults, findings
revealed that home Internet and social network site (SNS) use are associated with decreased PD over
time. Having extended family who are also Internet users further decreases PD. PD increased or
decreased in relation to change in the PD of extended family who also use SNSs. For most people,
ICT substantively reduce PD; in rare cases, an extreme spike in PD of extended family also on SNSs,
there was a trivial increase to the risk of SPD. PD did not change when extended family not on social
media experienced a change in their PD.
本文对信息技术与通信技术之间的关系进行了探讨随着互联网、手机和社交媒体的普及，心理压力(PD)也随着时间的推移而变化与抑郁和焦虑障碍相关的严重心理困扰(SPD)风险。使用纵向面板设计，调查数据来自美国成年人的代表性样本，发现发现家庭互联网和社交网站(SNS)的使用与降低PD over相关时间。大家庭成员同时也是互联网用户会进一步降低PD。PD增加或与同时使用社交网络的大家庭成员的PD变化相关。对大多数人来说,ICT实质性降低PD;在罕见的情况下，大家庭成员的PD也会在SNSs上急剧增加，SPD的风险略有增加。当大家庭成员不在社会上时，PD没有变化媒体经历了一次PD的变化。

### The Influence of Self-Generated and Third-Party Claims Online：Perceived Self-Interest as an Explanatory Mechanism

Over the past two decades, communication technology scholars have examined how viewers evaluate
the authenticity of information online, with particular attention given to how self versus thirdparty
claims differ in their degree of influence. We examine how self-interest perceptions serve an
important explanatory function in the logic of warranting theory and help account for how people
evaluate content online. Our results document how the source and valence of a message can interact
toaffect perceptions of source self-interest,which, inturn, affectperceptions of source trustworthiness,
message accuracy, and, ultimately, evaluations of an online target. The findings establish boundary
conditions for the warranting principle and our discussion offers insight into the production and
evaluation of online claims.

### Ethnic Minorities’ Social Media Political Use：How Ingroup Identification, Selective Exposure, and Collective Efficacy Shape Social Media Political Expression


### Permanently on Call：The Effects of Social Pressure on Smartphone Users’ Self-Control, Need Satisfaction, and Well-Being

While many smartphone users experience social pressure to be available, only some perceive this
as a burden. It was hypothesized that this form of social pressure is especially detrimental when it
reduces self-control and hinders need satisfaction. Study 1 experimentally tested whether the fulfillment
of intrinsic needs (i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness) in mobile communication
mediates these associations. Results show that social pressure negatively affected autonomy and
competence, but did not influence relatedness. Repeated-measures data from Study 2 suggest that
social pressure leads to self-control failure, which is associated with reduced competence. This
research is the first to develop and test a theoretical model of the effects of social pressure to be
available on self-control, need satisfaction, and individuals’ well-being.

### Whose Lives Matter？ Mass Shootings and Social Media Discourses of Sympathy and Policy, 2012–2014

This study focuses on the outpouring of sympathy in response to mass shootings and the contestation
over gun policy on Twitter from 2012 to 2014 and relates these discourses to features of mass
shooting events. We use two approaches to Twitter text analysis—hashtag grouping and supervised
machine learning (ML)—to triangulate an understanding of intensity and duration of
“thoughts and prayers,” gun control, and gun rights discourses. We conduct parallel time series
analyses to predict their temporal patterns in response to features of mass shootings. Our analyses
reveal that while the total number of victims and child deaths consistently predicted public grieving
and calls for gun control, public shootings consistently predicted the defense of gun rights.
Further, the race of victims and perpetrators affected the levels of public mourning and policy
debates, with the loss of black lives and the violence inflicted by white shooters generating less
sympathy and policy discourses.

### Is That My Friend or an Advert？The Effectiveness of Instagram Native Advertisements Posing as Social Posts
Advertisers have turned attention to the popular photograph-based social network Instagram.
One technique for reaching consumers has been advertisements resembling posts one’s friends
might make. These native advertisements use Instagram’s conventions and may be unrecognized
as sponsored messages at first glance, when browsing one’s Instagram. A within-subjects experiment
(N = 482) tested these native ads against both user-generated posts and traditional advertisements.
These message types were presented in a repeated-measures design, rotated across three
well-known brands, and interspersed with distractor posts. Results indicated that the three message
types produced similar effects on ad attitude, brand attitude, and behavioral intention.
However, user-generated social posts produced more credibility and social comparison than native
ads, and native ads produced more credibility and social comparison than advertisements. This
yielded indirect effects on dependent variables of interest, despite the lack of total effects.
Sponsorship recognition was relatively high for native ads but did not mediate effects.

### Motivations, Usage, and Perceived Social Networks Within and Beyond Social Media

This study addresses the questions of how individuals use social media (SM) to build awareness of
social networks (network perceptions) within and beyond SM, and how motivations and SM
behaviors differentiate individuals’ ability to build such awareness. The analysis of the 2017
Taiwan Communication Survey (TCS) identifies three types of users based on their motivations
for SM use: omnivores, time-killers, and social-groomers, who are differentiated from one another
in terms of different types of SM behaviors as well as perceived network structures on SM and
beyond. For example, omnivores, who use SM for diverse purposes, tend to engage in SM browsing
and reacting more than time-killers, who use SM to pass time. Compared to time-killers, socialgroomers,
those who use SM for social purposes, are more likely to perceive that they have a larger
SM response network, a response network containing close ties, and that they have maintained
diverse social relationships in the form of mixed-media relationships (MMRs). Moreover, SM
posting is associated with the size and the diverse composition of the perceived response network
on SM. More frequent SM posting is also associated with perceptions of having diverse social contacts
maintained through MMRs, but such association depends on the size and composition of the
perceived SM response network.

### Strategic Social Grooming：Emergent Social Grooming Styles on Facebook, Social Capital and Well-Being

Social grooming behaviors on social media contribute to one’s social capital and well-being. This
study considered common types of social interactions on social media and proposes a social
grooming style framework developed through signaling theory. Unlike the previous research,
which has examined a single type of social grooming behavior, this study examined many behaviors
simultaneously to identify a social grooming style. With a nationally representative sample
from Taiwan (N = 1,350), a latent class analysis (LCA) revealed five social grooming styles: image
managers, social butterflies, trend followers, maintainers, and lurkers. Social grooming style is significantly
associated with social capital and well-being. Image managers receive the most social
benefits, whereas lurkers receive the fewest. Social butterflies have considerable bridging social
capital and well-being but the least bonding social capital. The results suggest that the rich may
get richer, but only if the engaged social grooming style is strategic.

### Deaf and Hard of Hearing Smartphone Users：Intersectionality and the Penetration of Ableist Communication Norms

This article shows how smartphone usage among deaf and hard of hearing (HoH) people is
shaped by “normative” communication values, and how smartphones, despite seeming accessible,
can reproduce hegemonic communicative norms. Qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews conducted
in Israel shows that social norms of voice calls impact other smartphone interactions, such
that people who cannot perform voice calls are required to obey vocal norms of immediacy even
while interacting accessibly through text-based instant messaging (IM) apps or video calls.
Drawing on critical disability studies, we show how deaf and HoH smartphone users’ communicative
practices vary according to the intersections of their audiological status with other stigmatized
positions, which has profound implications for our understanding of media accessibility.

### Platform-swinging in a poly-social-media context：How and why users navigate multiple social media platforms

Guided by the frameworks of niche and polymedia theories, this study sought to understand the
phenomenon of platform-swinging on social media, which refers to the routine use of multiple
social media platforms that has become commonplace across different ages. Based on focus group
discussions (FGDs) with 62 social media users in Singapore, this study found that social media
users engage in platform-swinging for relationship management and self-presentation gratifications.
While these gratifications are also served by individual social media platforms, platformswinging
allows social media users to navigate structural, social, and norm barriers to obtain
greater gratification opportunities. This has implications on how social media users subsequently
regard and segment their personal relationships.

### What’s in a Smile？Politicizing Disability through Selﬁes and Affect

This article focuses on selfies and empowerment of individuals with physical disabilities. By
exploring the #FSHDselfies campaign as a case study, I discuss the role affect plays in mediated
advocacy for the representation of non-normative bodies, allowing disabled individuals to gather
as a community and disrupt contemporary beauty standards. I draw on the case study to rearticulate
the term “community of affect” (Climo, 2001) as the socio-political structure that promotes
marginalized groups’ negotiation of collective identity and communal action geared
towards cultural, social, and political change. This community can be seen as a sub-section or a
specific discursive space categorized under “affective publics” (Papacharissi, 2014). I show in this
context how participatory forms of representation open a space for negotiation and criticism of
marginalized groups on the one hand, while oversimplifying the complex and diverse lives of
minority groups on the other hand.
