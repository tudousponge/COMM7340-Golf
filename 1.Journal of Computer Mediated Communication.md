### Digital Communication Media Use and Psychological Well-Being：A Meta-Analysis

The puzzle of whether digital media are improving or harming psychological well-being has been
plaguing researchers and the public for decades. Derived from media richness theory, this study
proposed that phone calls and texting improve well-being, while use of social network sites (SNSs),
instant messaging (IM), and online gaming may displace other social contacts and, thereby, impair
well-being. To test this hypothesis, a meta-analysis of 124 studies was conducted. The results showed
that phone calls and texting were positively correlated with well-being, whereas online gaming was
negatively associated with well-being. Furthermore, the relationship between digital media use and
well-being was also contingent upon the way the technology was used. A series of meta-analyses
of different types of SNS use and well-being was used to elucidate this point: interaction, selfpresentation,
and entertainment on SNSs were associated with better well-being, whereas consuming
SNSs’ content was associated with poorer well-being.  
数字媒体究竟是在改善人们的心理健康，还是在损害人们的心理健康困扰了研究人员和公众几十年。本研究源于媒介丰富度理论提出打电话和发短信可以提高幸福感，而使用社交网站(SNSs)，即时通讯(IM)和在线游戏可能会取代其他的社会联系，从而损害幸福。为了验证这一假设，对124项研究进行了荟萃分析。结果显示打电话和发短信与幸福感呈正相关，而网络游戏与幸福感呈正相关与幸福感负相关。此外，数字媒体使用与幸福也取决于技术的使用方式。一系列的元分析不同类型的SNS使用和幸福感被用来说明这一点:互动，自我表现，SNSs上的娱乐与更好的幸福感相关，而消费则与之相反SNSs的内容与较差的幸福感相关。

### Flagging Facebook Falsehoods：Self-Identified Humor Warnings Outperform Fact Checker and Peer Warnings

We present two studies evaluating the effectiveness of flagging inaccurate political posts on social
media. In Study 1, we tested fact-checker flags, peer-generated flags, and a flag indicating that the
publisher self-identified as a source of humor. We predicted that all would be effective, that their
effectiveness would depend on prior beliefs, and that the self-identified humor flag would work best.
Conducting a 2-wave online experiment (N=218), we found that self-identified humor flags were
most effective, reducing beliefs and sharing intentions, especially among those predisposed to believe
the post.We found no evidence that warnings from fact checkers or peers were beneficial. Compared
to the alternatives, participants exposed to self-identified humor flags exhibited less reactance to
and had more positive appraisals of the flagging system. The second study (N=610) replicated the
findings of the first and provides a preliminary test of what makes this flag work.  
我们提出了两项研究，以评估在社会上标记不准确的政治帖子的有效性媒体。在研究1中，我们测试了事实检查器标志、同行生成标志和指示出版商自认为是幽默的源泉。我们预测，所有这些都将是有效的，他们的有效性取决于先前的信念，而自我认同的幽默标志效果最好。我们进行了一个两波在线实验(N=218)，发现自我识别的幽默标志是最有效的，减少信念和分享意图，特别是在那些倾向于相信的人之间这个职位。我们没有发现任何证据表明来自事实核查人员或同行的警告是有益的。相比在另一种情况下，暴露在自我认同幽默标志下的参与者对幽默表现出较少的抗拒对标记系统的评价更加积极。第二项研究(N=610)证实了这一结论第一个发现，并提供了一个初步的测试，什么使这面旗帜工作。

### Social Media and Change in Psychological Distress Over Time：The Role of Social Causation

This article tests the relationship between information and communication technologies (ICT), such
as the Internet, cell phones, and socialmedia, and change over time in psychological distress (PD) and
risk of serious psychological distress (SPD) associated with depression and anxiety disorders. Using
a longitudinal panel design, survey data from a representative sample of American adults, findings
revealed that home Internet and social network site (SNS) use are associated with decreased PD over
time. Having extended family who are also Internet users further decreases PD. PD increased or
decreased in relation to change in the PD of extended family who also use SNSs. For most people,
ICT substantively reduce PD; in rare cases, an extreme spike in PD of extended family also on SNSs,
there was a trivial increase to the risk of SPD. PD did not change when extended family not on social
media experienced a change in their PD.  
本文对信息技术与通信技术之间的关系进行了探讨随着互联网、手机和社交媒体的普及，心理压力(PD)也随着时间的推移而变化与抑郁和焦虑障碍相关的严重心理困扰(SPD)风险。使用纵向面板设计，调查数据来自美国成年人的代表性样本，发现发现家庭互联网和社交网站(SNS)的使用与降低PD over相关时间。大家庭成员同时也是互联网用户会进一步降低PD。PD增加或与同时使用社交网络的大家庭成员的PD变化相关。对大多数人来说,ICT实质性降低PD;在罕见的情况下，大家庭成员的PD也会在SNSs上急剧增加，SPD的风险略有增加。当大家庭成员不在社会上时，PD没有变化媒体经历了一次PD的变化。

### The Influence of Self-Generated and Third-Party Claims Online：Perceived Self-Interest as an Explanatory Mechanism

Over the past two decades, communication technology scholars have examined how viewers evaluate
the authenticity of information online, with particular attention given to how self versus thirdparty
claims differ in their degree of influence. We examine how self-interest perceptions serve an
important explanatory function in the logic of warranting theory and help account for how people
evaluate content online. Our results document how the source and valence of a message can interact
toaffect perceptions of source self-interest,which, inturn, affectperceptions of source trustworthiness,
message accuracy, and, ultimately, evaluations of an online target. The findings establish boundary
conditions for the warranting principle and our discussion offers insight into the production and
evaluation of online claims.

### Ethnic Minorities’ Social Media Political Use：How Ingroup Identification, Selective Exposure, and Collective Efficacy Shape Social Media Political Expression


### Permanently on Call：The Effects of Social Pressure on Smartphone Users’ Self-Control, Need Satisfaction, and Well-Being

While many smartphone users experience social pressure to be available, only some perceive this
as a burden. It was hypothesized that this form of social pressure is especially detrimental when it
reduces self-control and hinders need satisfaction. Study 1 experimentally tested whether the fulfillment
of intrinsic needs (i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness) in mobile communication
mediates these associations. Results show that social pressure negatively affected autonomy and
competence, but did not influence relatedness. Repeated-measures data from Study 2 suggest that
social pressure leads to self-control failure, which is associated with reduced competence. This
research is the first to develop and test a theoretical model of the effects of social pressure to be
available on self-control, need satisfaction, and individuals’ well-being.
尽管许多智能手机用户面临着社交压力，但只有一部分人意识到了这一点作为一个负担。据推测，这种形式的社会压力尤其有害降低自我控制和阻碍需求满足。研究1实验验证了是否满足内在需要(即在移动通信中的自主性、能力和关联性)调和这些关联。结果表明，社会压力对学生的自主能力和学习能力有负向影响能力，但不影响亲缘关系。研究2的重复测量数据表明社会压力导致自我控制失败，这与能力下降有关。这研究是第一个发展和测试社会压力影响的理论模型可用于自我控制、需求满足和个人幸福。

### Whose Lives Matter？ Mass Shootings and Social Media Discourses of Sympathy and Policy, 2012–2014

This study focuses on the outpouring of sympathy in response to mass shootings and the contestation
over gun policy on Twitter from 2012 to 2014 and relates these discourses to features of mass
shooting events. We use two approaches to Twitter text analysis—hashtag grouping and supervised
machine learning (ML)—to triangulate an understanding of intensity and duration of
“thoughts and prayers,” gun control, and gun rights discourses. We conduct parallel time series
analyses to predict their temporal patterns in response to features of mass shootings. Our analyses
reveal that while the total number of victims and child deaths consistently predicted public grieving
and calls for gun control, public shootings consistently predicted the defense of gun rights.
Further, the race of victims and perpetrators affected the levels of public mourning and policy
debates, with the loss of black lives and the violence inflicted by white shooters generating less
sympathy and policy discourses.
枪击事件。我们使用两种方法来进行Twitter文本分析—hashtag分组和监督机器学习(ML) -三角的理解强度和持续时间“思想与祈祷”，枪支管制，以及枪支权利。我们进行平行时间序列分析预测他们的时间模式，以应对大规模枪击事件的特点。我们的分析调查显示，虽然遇难者和儿童死亡的总人数与公众悲伤情绪一致
呼吁控制枪支，公众枪击事件始终预示着对持枪权利的捍卫。此外，受害者和犯罪者的种族影响了公众悼念和政策的程度随着黑人生命的丧失和白人枪手造成的暴力冲突的减少同情和政策话语。

### Is That My Friend or an Advert？The Effectiveness of Instagram Native Advertisements Posing as Social Posts
Advertisers have turned attention to the popular photograph-based social network Instagram.
One technique for reaching consumers has been advertisements resembling posts one’s friends
might make. These native advertisements use Instagram’s conventions and may be unrecognized
as sponsored messages at first glance, when browsing one’s Instagram. A within-subjects experiment
(N = 482) tested these native ads against both user-generated posts and traditional advertisements.
These message types were presented in a repeated-measures design, rotated across three
well-known brands, and interspersed with distractor posts. Results indicated that the three message
types produced similar effects on ad attitude, brand attitude, and behavioral intention.
However, user-generated social posts produced more credibility and social comparison than native
ads, and native ads produced more credibility and social comparison than advertisements. This
yielded indirect effects on dependent variables of interest, despite the lack of total effects.
Sponsorship recognition was relatively high for native ads but did not mediate effects.
广告商已经将注意力转向了基于图片的社交网络Instagram。一种接触消费者的方法是发布类似朋友的广告可能会使。这些原生广告使用了Instagram的惯例，可能不会被认出来浏览Instagram时第一眼看到的赞助信息。一个受试实验(N = 482)将这些原生广告与用户生成的帖子和传统广告进行对比。这些消息类型以一种重复度量设计的形式呈现，并在三种设计中轮换使用知名品牌，并散布着分散注意力的帖子。结果表明，这三个消息类型对广告态度、品牌态度和行为意向的影响相似。然而，用户生成的社交帖子比原生的更能产生可信度和社会比较与广告相比，本土广告产生了更多的可信度和社会比较。这产生了对相关因变量的间接影响，尽管缺乏总体影响。赞助认可度相对较高的原生广告，但没有间接影响。

### Motivations, Usage, and Perceived Social Networks Within and Beyond Social Media

This study addresses the questions of how individuals use social media (SM) to build awareness of
social networks (network perceptions) within and beyond SM, and how motivations and SM
behaviors differentiate individuals’ ability to build such awareness. The analysis of the 2017
Taiwan Communication Survey (TCS) identifies three types of users based on their motivations
for SM use: omnivores, time-killers, and social-groomers, who are differentiated from one another
in terms of different types of SM behaviors as well as perceived network structures on SM and
beyond. For example, omnivores, who use SM for diverse purposes, tend to engage in SM browsing
and reacting more than time-killers, who use SM to pass time. Compared to time-killers, socialgroomers,
those who use SM for social purposes, are more likely to perceive that they have a larger
SM response network, a response network containing close ties, and that they have maintained
diverse social relationships in the form of mixed-media relationships (MMRs). Moreover, SM
posting is associated with the size and the diverse composition of the perceived response network
on SM. More frequent SM posting is also associated with perceptions of having diverse social contacts
maintained through MMRs, but such association depends on the size and composition of the
perceived SM response network.
本研究探讨了个人如何利用社会媒体(SM)来建立意识的问题社会网络(网络感知)在SM之内和之外，以及动机和SM如何行为区分了个人建立这种意识的能力。2017年的分析
台湾传播调查(TCS)根据用户的动机分为三类适用于SM:杂食动物，消磨时间的，社交型的，彼此不同的不同类型的SM行为，以及对SM和网络结构的感知超越。例如，出于不同目的而使用SM的杂食者倾向于浏览SM而不是用SM来打发时间。与消磨时间的人、社交室友相比，那些为了社交目的而使用SM的人，更有可能认为他们有一个更大的
SM响应网络，一个包含紧密联系的响应网络，并由他们维护以混合媒体关系(MMRs)形式存在的多样化社会关系。此外,SM张贴是与大小和不同组成的感知反应网络在SM。SM发帖频率越高，人们对社交接触的感觉也越丰富通过mmr来维持，但是这种联系取决于mmr的大小和组成感知SM反应网络。

### Strategic Social Grooming：Emergent Social Grooming Styles on Facebook, Social Capital and Well-Being

Social grooming behaviors on social media contribute to one’s social capital and well-being. This
study considered common types of social interactions on social media and proposes a social
grooming style framework developed through signaling theory. Unlike the previous research,
which has examined a single type of social grooming behavior, this study examined many behaviors
simultaneously to identify a social grooming style. With a nationally representative sample
from Taiwan (N = 1,350), a latent class analysis (LCA) revealed five social grooming styles: image
managers, social butterflies, trend followers, maintainers, and lurkers. Social grooming style is significantly
associated with social capital and well-being. Image managers receive the most social
benefits, whereas lurkers receive the fewest. Social butterflies have considerable bridging social
capital and well-being but the least bonding social capital. The results suggest that the rich may
get richer, but only if the engaged social grooming style is strategic.
社交媒体上的社交修饰行为有助于一个人的社会资本和幸福。这研究考虑了社交媒体上常见的社交互动类型，并提出了社交梳理风格框架是通过信号理论发展起来的。与之前的研究不同，本研究考察了单一类型的社交梳理行为，考察了许多行为同时确定一种社交修饰风格。具有全国代表性的样本在台湾(N = 1,350)，一个潜在的阶级分析(LCA)揭示了五种社会修饰风格:形象管理者、社交达人、潮流追随者、维护者和潜行者。社交修饰风格很重要与社会资本和福利相关。形象经理获得最多的社交而潜水者得到的好处最少。社交蝴蝶有相当多的社交桥梁资本和福利，但联系最少的社会资本。结果表明富人可能会让自己变得更富有，但前提是社交修饰风格是战略性的。

### Deaf and Hard of Hearing Smartphone Users：Intersectionality and the Penetration of Ableist Communication Norms

This article shows how smartphone usage among deaf and hard of hearing (HoH) people is
shaped by “normative” communication values, and how smartphones, despite seeming accessible,
can reproduce hegemonic communicative norms. Qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews conducted
in Israel shows that social norms of voice calls impact other smartphone interactions, such
that people who cannot perform voice calls are required to obey vocal norms of immediacy even
while interacting accessibly through text-based instant messaging (IM) apps or video calls.
Drawing on critical disability studies, we show how deaf and HoH smartphone users’ communicative
practices vary according to the intersections of their audiological status with other stigmatized
positions, which has profound implications for our understanding of media accessibility.
这篇文章展示了智能手机在聋人和重听(HoH)人群中的使用情况受“规范”沟通价值观的影响，以及智能手机尽管看起来触手可及，可以复制霸权性的交际规范。定性分析所进行的深度访谈以色列的研究表明，语音通话的社会规范会影响其他智能手机的互动，比如那些不能进行语音通话的人甚至被要求遵守即时的声音规范通过基于文本的即时消息(IM)应用程序或视频电话进行可访问的交互。利用重要的残疾研究，我们展示了聋哑人和HoH智能手机用户如何交流不同的实践根据其交叉点的听力地位与其他耻辱这对我们理解媒体可达性有着深远的影响。

### Platform-swinging in a poly-social-media context：How and why users navigate multiple social media platforms

Guided by the frameworks of niche and polymedia theories, this study sought to understand the
phenomenon of platform-swinging on social media, which refers to the routine use of multiple
social media platforms that has become commonplace across different ages. Based on focus group
discussions (FGDs) with 62 social media users in Singapore, this study found that social media
users engage in platform-swinging for relationship management and self-presentation gratifications.
While these gratifications are also served by individual social media platforms, platformswinging
allows social media users to navigate structural, social, and norm barriers to obtain
greater gratification opportunities. This has implications on how social media users subsequently
regard and segment their personal relationships.
本研究以生态位理论和多元媒体理论为理论框架，探讨生态位与多元媒体之间的关系社交媒体平台摇摆的现象，指的是多个平台的日常使用社交媒体平台已经成为不同年龄层的普遍现象。基于焦点小组在新加坡与62名社交媒体用户的讨论(FGDs)中，本研究发现社交媒体用户为了关系管理和自我表现的满足而转向平台。而这些满足也由个体的社交媒体平台提供，平台摇摆允许社交媒体用户通过结构性、社会性和规范性障碍获取信息更大的满足的机会。这对社交媒体用户随后的行为产生了影响尊重并分割他们的人际关系。

### What’s in a Smile？Politicizing Disability through Selﬁes and Affect

This article focuses on selfies and empowerment of individuals with physical disabilities. By
exploring the #FSHDselfies campaign as a case study, I discuss the role affect plays in mediated
advocacy for the representation of non-normative bodies, allowing disabled individuals to gather
as a community and disrupt contemporary beauty standards. I draw on the case study to rearticulate
the term “community of affect” (Climo, 2001) as the socio-political structure that promotes
marginalized groups’ negotiation of collective identity and communal action geared
towards cultural, social, and political change. This community can be seen as a sub-section or a
specific discursive space categorized under “affective publics” (Papacharissi, 2014). I show in this
context how participatory forms of representation open a space for negotiation and criticism of
marginalized groups on the one hand, while oversimplifying the complex and diverse lives of
minority groups on the other hand.

### Cracking the Tinder Code：An Experience Sampling Approach to the Dynamics and Impact of Platform Governing Algorithms
This article conceptualizes algorithmically-governed platforms as the outcomes of a structuration
process involving three types of actors: platform owners/developers, platform users, and machine
learning algorithms. This threefold conceptualization informs media effects research, which still
struggles to incorporate algorithmic influence. It invokes insights into algorithmic governance
from platform studies and (critical) studies in the political economy of online platforms. This
approach illuminates platforms’ underlying technological and economic logics, which allows to
construct hypotheses on how they appropriate algorithmic mechanisms, and how these mechanisms
function. The present study tests the feasibility of experience sampling to test such hypotheses.
The proposed methodology is applied to the case of mobile dating app Tinder.

### Explaining the Emergence of Political Fragmentation on Social Media：The Role of Ideology and Extremism

This article is a systematic large-scale study of the reasons driving political fragmentation on
social media. Making use of a comparative dataset of the Twitter discussion activities of 115 political
groups in 26 countries, it shows that groups that are further apart in ideological terms interact
less, and that groups that sit at the extremes of the ideological scale are particularly likely to have
lower patterns of interaction. Indeed, exchanges between centrists who sit on different sides of the
left–right divide are more likely than connections between centrists and extremists who are from
the same ideological wing. In light of the results, theory about exposure to different ideological
viewpoints online is enhanced.

### Cyberbullying Bystander Intervention：The Number of Offenders and Retweeting Predict Likelihood of Helping a Cyberbullying Victim

Cyberbullying happens while bystanders are watching. To understand cyberbystanders’ experience,
the present experiment investigates how repetitive aspects of online communication influence
bystanders’ perceptions and intentions to halt cyberbullying. We consider the role repetition
plays in identifying cyberbullying, and outline two of its mechanisms—power imbalance and
intention. Participants (N = 133) were exposed to messages on Twitter that either contained
retweets or original offenses from one or several offenders. Although cyberbystanders were generally
unwilling to intervene, seeing several offenders increased their likelihood of engaging in the
Bystander Intervention Model’s (BIM) stages. Further, re-sharing moderated the effect of number of
offenders suggesting cyberbystanders may be less willing to intervene when they read re-shared rather
than original content. Implications for cyberbystander interventions are discussed.

### One Size Fits All：Context Collapse, Self-Presentation Strategies and Language Styles on Facebook

This study empirically examines context collapse on Facebook by examining audience influences
on content and language in self-disclosures. Context collapse is the process of disparate audiences
being conjoined into one. Using a public longitudinal behavioral data set of 6,378 Facebook users,
the study found that the size and heterogeneity of people’s networks were positively associated
with the number of text status updates they posted, but negatively associated with language style
variability of these updates during 12 months. Results suggest that people manage their online
self-presentation in ways that are consistent with lowest common denominator, imagined audience,
and accommodation propositions. Network size was positively associated with the proportion
of positive emotional language and negatively with negative emotional language, whereas
heterogeneity had the opposite effect.

### Performing a Vanilla Self：Respectability Politics, Social Class, and the Digital World

“Respectability politics” describes a self-presentation strategy historically adopted by African-American
women to reject White stereotypes by promoting morality while de-emphasizing sexuality. While civil
rights activists and feminists criticize respectability politics as reactionary, subordinated groups frequently
use these tactics to gain upward mobility. This paper analyzes how upwardly mobile young people of low
socio-economic status in New York City manage impressions online by adhering to normative notions of
respectability. Our participants described how they present themselves on social media by self-censoring,
curating a neutral image, segmenting content by platform, and avoiding content and contacts coded as
lower class. Peers who post sexual images, primarily women, were considered unrespectable and subject
to sexual shaming. These strategies reinforce racist and sexist notions of appropriate behavior, simultaneously
enabling and limiting participants’ ability to succeed.We extend the impression management literature
to examine how digital media mediates the intersection of class, gender, and race.
“尊重政治”描述了非裔美国人历史上采用的一种自我表现策略女性拒绝白人的刻板印象，提倡道德而不强调性。而民事人权活动家和女权主义者经常批评尊重政治是反动的、从属的团体利用这些策略来获得向上的流动性。这篇文章分析了社会底层的年轻人是如何向上流动的纽约市的社会经济地位通过遵循规范的概念来管理在线印象得到尊重。我们的参与者描述了他们如何通过自我审查在社交媒体上展示自己，管理一个中立的图像，根据平台分割内容，避免内容和联系人编码为下层阶级。发布性图片的同辈人，主要是女性，被认为是不受尊重和受人尊敬的性羞辱。这些策略同时强化了种族主义和性别歧视关于适当行为的观念培养和限制参与者成功的能力。我们扩展了印象管理文献探讨数位媒体如何调解阶级、性别和种族的交集。
