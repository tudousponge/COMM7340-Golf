1:The application named ZAO, Which is mobile app that uses AI technology to allow netizens to replace the portrait of an actor with a photo of their own face, developed by Chinese dating app named Momo began circulating

2:当你拍了一张照片后，手机会通过自身的 AI 算法来做进一步处理，一些以往需要在后期处理的事情，如今再按下快门的时候就完成了，这大大降低用户的后期成本，提升了成片的美感度。从AI拍照衍生出的AI美颜是通过采集面部的特征点，然后智能分析出用户的年龄、肤色等特性，然后采用面部分区或者多维组合的方式进行精细化美颜，让成片更为精准。从各家的拍摄样张来看，AI美颜在细节的处理好更为出色，眼部卧蚕、肌肤纹理、唇纹等细节都保留了下来，在祛痘美白提色等方面更为自然，不会有早期美颜的那种大片涂抹感，整个照片看上去层次感更强，十分讨人喜。从目前 AI 拍照所展示的变化看来，AI 拍摄确实会影响我们的拍摄行为，数字算法似乎也是想引导我们往它指定的的方向走。
